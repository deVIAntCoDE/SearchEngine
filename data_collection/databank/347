congo bridging the past principal artery of commerce in the
congo was traditionally the congolese national route, a 1,725-mile
rail-riverrail connection from elisabethville in katanga to the
atlantic gateway at matadi . but the route became unusable with the
outbreak of civil war . whenever katanga's secessionist moise tshombe
felt events going against him, he quickly ordered another railroad
bridge blown up . thus, since 1960 most traffic has moved on alternate
rail lines through portuguese angola and mozambique . but the routes
across foreign territory soak up revenue badly needed within the congo,
and last week premier cyrille adoula hopefully dedicated a new railroad
bridge at bukama, the final rebuilt link in the katanga-matadi run . "
this is not only a bridge over the lualaba river, " said adoula . " it
is a bridge over the unhappy past . " though a milestone of sorts, the
bukama bridge also marks the petty pace of congolese unity, for the
steamy 25-day trip by barge and boxcar remains an awesome obstacle
course . some of the 23 congolese provinces created since 1962 claim
authority to levy import-export duties as the mood strikes them . also,
tribal tensions necessitate frequent changes of engineers as trains
pass from one region to the next . if the local folk spot an enemy at
the controls, they might swarm aboard and kill him on the spot .
