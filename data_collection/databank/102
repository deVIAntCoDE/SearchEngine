west germany looking eastward for years, the west german
government has nursed a certain longing for closer ties with
neighboring eastern europe, in part because moscow's underdeveloped
satellites would be a juicy market for bonn's heavy industrial goods .
but communist poland, for one, kept insisting on a major political
surrender before any deal was signed : full diplomatic recognition of
wladyslaw gomulka's polish regime, and acceptance of poland's
oderneisse western frontier, which includes a big chunk of pre-world
war ii germany . with 14 million angry refugees from the east added to
its population since the war, the bonn government could hardly swallow
that kind of proposition . last week, after three months of delicate
negotiations in warsaw, poland at last dropped its tough demands, and
the two sides signed their first long-term trade agreement, a
three-year, $650 million pact exchanging west german machinery and
metals for polish meat, fruit and dairy products . west germany will
send a permanent trade mission to warsaw, its first permanent outpost
in a soviet satellite land . bonn officials clearly feel the way is
open for similar deals with hungary and czechoslovakia .
