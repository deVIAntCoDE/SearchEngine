russia a
long, hot summer for months, dozens of speakers in scores of soviet
cities had been readying their ponderous lecture texts for the most
anxiously awaited date on the kremlin's spring calendar of events, may
28, when a special meeting of the communist party central committee
plenum would lay down the ideological law to restless intellectuals .
last week the long-scheduled meeting was put off until june 18 . the
last-minute breakdown in the kremlin's usually well oiled machinery
naturally touched off a wave of speculation . could nikita khrushchev
be having second thoughts over unleashing a wave of neo-stalinism ?
was the delay caused by the reported heart attack of the party's second
secretary, hard-liner frol kozlov (time, may 10), whose tough hand
might be needed on the spot to draft the orders for a cultural
crackdown ? was it another ploy against red china ? who knew ?
whatever was behind postponement of the plenum, the abrupt switch
served to delay moscow's coming confrontation with its rivals in peking
. two weeks ago, the red chinese finally got around to answering the
soviet invitation to discuss their nasty ideological quarrel face to
face, suggested a mid-june meeting in moscow . but since the soviets
could scarcely conduct two showdowns at the same moment, they suggested
a new date, july 5 . for once, peking said yes .
