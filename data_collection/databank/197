the congo the cops protest the congo's latest mutiny began on
payday . opening up their pay envelopes last week, leopoldville's
3,000-man police force discovered that their demand for a 25 per cent
wage hike had not been met . at dawn the next morning, the angry cops
overpowered their own officers, then raided leopoldville's city hall,
where they took some two dozen hostages, including two deputy mayors
and the mayor's pregnant wife . barricading themselves in their police
barracks, the well-armed cops waited for the government to ante up more
money . instead, premier cyrille adoula's government dispatched the
congolese army commander, general joseph mobutu, and units of
red-bereted paracommandos to the police compound . ordering his men not
to shoot, mobutu opened the camp's gate and strode in alone and unarmed
to face the mutineers . roughly he yanked the ringleaders out of the
mob one by one, and demanded that they give up . with that the revolt
collapsed, and mobutu his well-creased trousers stained with a spot of
blood ordered the mutiny's leaders stripped to their underwear and
driven off to jail through the jeering crowd at the camp's gate .
