great britain wooing the middle class when 244 labor members of
parliament voted secretly last week to name a new labor party leader,
they did so for the first time in eleven years with some confidence
that they might also be picking britain's next prime minister . the
prospect seemed to have influenced the voting considerably . in the
first round of electing a successor to the late hugh gaitskell, harold
wilson, 46, last week won an unexpectedly handsome lead over his two
opponents . he got 115 votes ; gaitskell's deputy, acting leader
george brown, an early favorite, got 88 ; and a third candidate, james
callaghan, who was automatically eliminated, got 41 . only eight votes
short of the outright majority needed for victory on the first ballot,
wilson became an odds-on favorite to defeat brown in this week's runoff
. in voting for portly, pipe-puffing wilson, a onetime oxford don who
draws most of his support from the left and was one of hugh gaitskell's
archrivals, labor m.p.s apparently had in mind not his ruthless
opportunism but the fact that he, like gaitskell, is a middle-class
intellectual . by contrast with earthy george brown, a blunt, diligent
anti-communist with strong union support, many laborites believe that
harold wilson will have more appeal for middle-class voters, who
have become increasingly disenchanted with prime minister harold
macmillan . an effective president of the
board of trade for 3f years in the
last labor government, wilson, at 31,
was the youngest cabinet minister
appointed in 165 years .
