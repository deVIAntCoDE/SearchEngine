/ get down to production " with the idea men out of the way,
khrushchev turned to the painful problem of russia's factories and
farms . casting about for a way to boost industrial output, the premier
called a special joint session of the communist party presidium and the
government's council of ministers, which announced creation of a new,
all-powerful supreme economic council, discarding at last the
discredited scheme for regional industrial autonomy that was installed
in 1957 . at the same meeting, khrushchev scrapped the last two years
of his much-touted seven-year plan (1964-65) and ordered the new
economic czars to get busy and draft a new set of quotas . the bouncy
premier also turned up at a moscow meeting of agricultural experts and
explained why he fired the soviet agriculture minister fornight ago
(time, march 15) . he spent too much time writing directives from
moscow and too little time on the road, inspecting the farms he was
ordering about . " the cows can't read directives, " scolded nikita . "
all they want is a just exchange : " you give me fodder, i give you
milk . " ' and of milk and meat, he admitted, there is " still very,
very little . we have already criticized the writers for bad works .
you obviously won't do as writers . better get down to production . "
