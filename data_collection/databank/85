libya sunset shock on their fertile plateau, 930 feet above the
mediterranean, the moslem citizens of el marj (pop . 13,000) welcomed
the sunset one day last week . it brought to an end another day-long
fast imposed by the holy month of ramadan . families gathered at table
to break their fast with the traditional ramadan dinner and many died
where they were sitting, for sunset brought the shock and terror of the
worst earthquake in libyan history . for 15 seconds the earth shook,
crumbling brick-and-plaster houses and mosques into rubble . some
survivors wandered in the streets, wailing in anguish as they searched
for relatives and friends . others huddled dazedly over fires in the
open fields while rain and heavy winds made the night miserable, and
morning brought two more earth tremors . el marj had lived through
bombing and battles during world war ii as british and axis forces took
and retook the town . but the quake flattened el marj as war never did
. rescue workers said that not a single house remained habitable, and
the libyan red crescent appealed for help to the international red
cross . the u.s . air force rushed paramedics and tents from wheelus
airbase at tripoli, and the british ferried in doctors and nurses from
their base at nearby benghazi . at week's end more than 200 bodies had
been recovered and an estimated 300500 still lay buried in the ruins .
