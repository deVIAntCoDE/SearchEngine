common market back to work when charles de gaulle shocked europe
with his highhanded exclusion of britain from the common market last
january, many european officials speculated that the general's action
might permanently disrupt the common market's progress . indeed, for
two months, meeting after meeting at brussels ended in recrimination
and deadlock . but finally last week the rest of the six swallowed
their resentment at france and got back to business as before . two and
a half years ahead of schedule, the common market nations voted another
10 per cent slash in each nation's customs duties on industrial
imports from other members of the community, and agreed to cut by 20
per cent the average tariff on a wide range of industrial goods
imported from outside the common market . the latest reduction was
plainly intended as a goodwill gesture on the eve of tariff-cutting
negotiations with the u.s . in geneva next month . however, what the
u.s . is primarily anxious to secure at geneva its european market for
agricultural exports will not be up for negotiation, since the common
market nations last week were unable to agree on their own price levels
