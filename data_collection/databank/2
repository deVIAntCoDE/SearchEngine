russia who's in charge here ? it was in 1954 that nikita
khrushchev launched his grandiose " virgin lands " gamble . part of the
plan was to plow up 32 million acres of marginal land in kazakhstan,
and settle it with communist " pioneers, " who were to plant and
produce huge quantities of desperately needed grain within two years .
nikita's scheme flopped . there was not enough rainfall, and the
pioneers did not take to tractor life on the bleak frontier . except
for 1958, each harvest has been lower than the previous year's . worst
year of all was 1962, when the virgin lands delivered only half their
quotas . naturally, khrushchev takes none of the blame for the fiasco .
three years ago he found a scapegoat in kazakhstan party boss nikolai
belyaev, fired him for his " errors . " last week belyaev's successor,
dinmukhamed kunaev, was similarly bounced for " lapses " in his work .
for good measure, moscow also purged the former premier of the
territory from the local party's central committee . it was perhaps no
coincidence that nikolai ignatov, 61, a onetime khrushchev crony, last
week abruptly left his post as a soviet deputy premier after only nine
months on the job . farm expert ignatov had the misfortune to be boss
of a special committee to boost food production .
