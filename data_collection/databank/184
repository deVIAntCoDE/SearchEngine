kashmir toward the final round four conferences in the past four
months have failed to get india and pakistan any closer to a settlement

indian prime minister nehru . but time was running out . said chief
pakistani negotiator zulfikar ali bhutto : " we have told india that
the sixth round will be the final round . /
