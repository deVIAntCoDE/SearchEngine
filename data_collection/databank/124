france 6,000 miles from home former premier michel debre is such
a listless political personality that a current joke says he was once
seen riding in an empty limousine . he has a fussy manner and a flat-
whining voice that somehow rub politicians and many other frenchmen the
wrong way, obscuring his considerable administrative talents . in
charles de gaulle's electoral landslide last november, debre the
dedicated gaullist, major architect of the fifth republic's
constitution, and the man who served a longer uninterrupted period as
premier (1,193 days) than any other in french parliamentary history was
ignominiously defeated in his own carefully cultivated rural
constituency by a local garage owner . de gaulle, who himself had used
debre as whipping boy for many of the regime's mistakes, soon found,
however, that he sorely missed debre's parliamentary skill . gaullist
aides began to ponder ways to get him back into the legislature, where,
if elected, he was likely to become majority leader . trouble was, no
gaullist faction in france itself wanted him . but at last a
constituency was found where debre seemed unlikely to lose week the
former premier gulped hard and accepted a bid to run for office on
reunion island, a tiny french dot in the indian ocean nearly 6,000
miles from paris .
