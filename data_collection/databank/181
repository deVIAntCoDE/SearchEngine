jordan the hot breath of nasser it was only a matter of time
before the emotional repercussions of gamal abdel nasser's arab unity
movement would sweep across the kingdom of jordan . last week nasserite
crowds swarmed through jerusalem and towns on the west bank of the
jordan river, shooting off rifles and tommy guns and demanding
immediate merger with nasser's projected federation . king hussein
called out desert troops and police reinforcements, clamped an
emergency curfew on the holy city . in the capital city of amman,
shouting students carrying arab unity flags with a fourth star for
jordan were peacefully dispersed, but armored cars warily patrolled the
streets . a few hours later, in a stormy debate in amman's house of
representatives, 32 of the 60 legislators rose to attack the policies
of prime minister samir rifai, whom hussein had appointed only 24 days
earlier . rifai was in favor of linking jordan with nasser's group, but
wanted to take his time about it . the parliamentarians did not want to
wait . after nine hours of it, rifai stormed out of the chamber, handed
his resignation to king hussein .
