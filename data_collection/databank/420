india     sea lawyer     ever since red china's surprise attack a
year ago, india's traditional policy of neutrality has been more
honored in words than in deeds . while mounting the old homilies about
nonalignment, india has petitioned the west for $1.5 billion in
military aid and has agreed to a western air-defense umbrella . last
week the u.s . seventh fleet prepared to take up positions in the
indian ocean . the question was broached to indian prime minister
jawaharlal nehru by chairman of the joint chiefs of staff maxwell d .
taylor on a visit to india last week . under the proposal, a task
force of one aircraft carrier with nuclear bomb-carrying jets
and four escort ships would patrol in the indian ocean for two to
four months at a time . supplied by support vessels, the task
force would never have to tie up at any indian port for provisions .
predictably, the seventh fleet proposal stirred up protests . the
indian press maintained that the plan was another threat to indian
neutrality, pakistan claimed that it was a hostile gesture on the
part of both countries, and red china said that it was another
example of the subversion of india by western imperialists . as for
nehru, he performed like a sea lawyer in lukewarmly endorsing the plan .
"how can we object to anyone going where he likes on the high seas," he
asked .
