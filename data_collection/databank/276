the ukrainian candidates the khrushchev succession sweepstakes
began all over again last week when the communist party central
committee named two new secretaries . out in front is soviet president
leonid brezhnev, 56, a shrewd, swarthy metallurgical engineer whom
khrushchev plucked from an obscure job in the ukraine little more than
a decade ago . brezhnev will now probably give up the merely ceremonial
functions of the soviet presidency, take over as taskmaster of heavy
industry and armaments . the second new secretary is ukrainian party
boss nikolai podgorny, 60, who is expected to take over the supervision
of party cadres . both men were already members of the central
committee's inner sanctum, the presidium . now, as secretaries of the
committee as well, they move into the most elite echelon of the soviet
hierarchy . only four other red leaders hold such a double position,
and none is khrushchev's likely successor . the four : frol kozlov,
54, who suffered a severe stroke in april ; elderly otto kuusinen, 81
; senior theoretician mikhail suslov, 60, compromised by a stalinist
past; and khrushchev himself .
