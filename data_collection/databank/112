russia tosca & a cold climate out of the soviet boondocks comes
a rising tide of complaints about the kind of people the moscow
authorities send out to the hinterland . too often, they are
troublemakers who are supposed to be reformed through hard work .
instead, they just make more trouble . in vladivostok exiled young
toughs formed a bandit gang that terrorized the city and knifed to
death a young communist leader ; deportees to a ukrainian collective
farm last year drank so much booze that they were barred from the
liquor stores, turned in desperation to eau de cologne . last week came
an angry gripe in literaturnaya gazeta from a siberian housewife who
demanded that leningrad stop sending its prostitutes 2,735 miles to
irkutsk and surrounding villages . the housewife was especially upset
about a young lady named tosca, whose fame was so great that it
preceded her arrival in siberia . " won't this piece of goods find
admirers even in a new place ? " asked the matron . " she probably
will . i know that the wives of a few bodaibo miners, for example,
asked the authorities to stop sending the likes of tosca to bodaibo .
this desire to push their unfinished goods onto others is wrong .
