france coping with an old foe the joke in paris was that charles
de gaulle did not know bifteck prices were going up until his wife,
tante yvonne, told him . wherever de gaulle got the news about french
inflation, he moved swiftly last week to bring it under control .
inflation is as typically french as are street demonstrations and often
the two are linked . all french governments tend to grapple vainly with
the problem . premier paul ramadier fought a game but losing battle in
1947 ; premier antoine pinay launched a " save the franc " campaign in
1952 . now de gaulle is struggling against the same hydraheaded enemy
: rising prices, up 16 per cent in three years ; wage boosts, which
only increase the cost spiral ; and the fury of farmers .
in an unusual move, de gaulle summoned his cabinet during the
vacation month of august, and sourly noted that without economic and
financial stability france could not have the glorious " policy
consistent with her interests . " premier georges pompidou, an
ex-banker, candidly said that all frenchmen were jiggling tax returns a
bit in their own favor, lamented that " while an american always wants
to demonstrate that he earns more than his neighbor, the frenchman
always wants to show you he earns less . " credit restrictions and
budgetary measures highlighted the new corrective plan announced by the
government last week . banks are limited to a 10 per cent increase in
loan portfolios . installment buying has been tightened by increasing
down payments . in a nationwide tv speech, finance minister valery
giscard d'estaing said the success of the plan depends " on two things
: conscience and confidence . " the press was neither hostile nor
enthusiastic . as usual, charles de gaulle had the last word . to his
cabinet he said, " if this doesn't do it, we'll go still farther . "
