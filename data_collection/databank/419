south viet nam     please send orders    in the two months since the
overthrow of president ngo dinh diem, the news out of south viet nam
has been mostly bad . the communist viet cong have scored alarming
gains in vital long an province south of saigon, which feeds the
capital . for all the fanfare with which they were welcomed by diem's
critics, the generals who succeeded the slain president have
demonstrated an unsettling lack of political leadership; recently, the
civilian chiefs of nine northern provinces relayed a plea to junta
chairman major general duong van ("big") minh:  "please send us
orders ." last week u.s . defense secretary robert s . mcnamara flew
from the nato meeting in paris to saigon, for his second viet nam
inspection visit in three months . joined by u.s . central
intelligence agency chief john a . mccone, mcnamara plunged into
briefings at the u.s . military mission . then he spent an
afternoon conferring with big minh and the other junta chiefs . under
discussion were plans for a major new offensive against the viet cong .
before boarding his plane for home, mcnamara turned to vietnamese
defense minister major general tran van don with some stern
words of advice . "now," said mcnamara, "let's be real tough ."
