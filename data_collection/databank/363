red china who needs pants ? peking last week publicly
admitted that red china will not have its longpromised nuclear bomb for
a long time to come . foreign minister marshal chen yi conceded that
economic troubles and the quarrel with the russians (who withdrew their
technicians and broke an atomic-aid treaty) have seriously delayed
peking's atomic program . it would be " several years, " chen told
visiting japanese correspondents, before the regime could even test a
crude atom bomb . but china is far from giving up its nuclear ambitions
. some time ago, khrushchev warned that any country trying to build a
bomb without adequate resources might lose its pants . nevertheless,
said chen, sounding like an echo of charles de gaulle, " at the risk of
losing our pants, we are determined to go ahead and build our own
atomic bombs . otherwise we will end up as a second- or third-class
nation .
