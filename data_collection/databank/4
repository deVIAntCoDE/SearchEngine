the road to jail is paved with nonobjective art since the
kremlin's sharpest barbs these days are aimed at modern art and "
western espionage, " it was just a matter of time before the kgb's cops
would turn up a victim whose wrongdoings combined both evils . he
turned out to be a leningrad physics teacher whose taste for abstract
painting allegedly led him to join the u.s . spy service . police said
they first spotted the teacher, one rudolf friedman, as he muttered
uncomplimentary remarks about socialist realism while strolling through
leningrad's russian museum . a well-dressed u.s . tourist approached
him, enthusiastically shared his sentiments, and promised to send
friedman reproductions of avant-garde paintings from america . the
picture friedman liked best, said the cops indignantly, was a " chaos
of black, red and blue splotches captioned i need you tonight . " soon,
they said, the teacher was getting messages from the u.s . written in
invisible ink . just as friedman prepared to deliver information " very
remote from theoretical arguments about abstract art, " policemoved in
and hustled him off to jail .
