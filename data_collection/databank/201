ceylon hooch in the hold although it has never fought a
war, the bathtub royal ceylon navy might at least be expected to
defend its homeland, off southern india, against smugglers . but last
week many a ceylonese was wondering whose side of the smuggling racket
the fleet was really on . climaxing a two-year investigation, a
commission of inquiry in colombo accused 22 ceylonese navy officers the
cream of the top naval leadership of conspiring to smuggle a
treasure-trove of contraband into the country . chief among them is the
former naval chief of staff, rear admiral royce de mel, 47 . when he
sailed grandly home from a 1960 goodwill cruise in asian waters, the
commission charged, the magazines of de mel's flagship and an escorting
frigate had been loaded with some $10,000 worth of bounty bought in
duty-free ports . main source was singapore, where de mel's bluejackets
had joyously laid in 100 cases of grant's scotch, 25 cases of other
brands of whisky, plus cases of rum, gin, brandy, champagne and beer,
intended for disposal back home . investigators added that the hot
cargo also included crated refrigerators, hi-fi sets, transistor
radios, furniture, rare hong kong vases and gold bangles most,
unfortunately, confiscated by ceylon authorities after the fleet
dropped anchor upon its return . de mel and his fellow brass now stand
to lose their commissions, but the prospect is the lesser of the
admiral's worries . with 27 other suspects, he is already in prison,
accused of participating in an abortive plot last year to overthrow
ceylon's strongwoman prime minister, mrs . sirimavo bandaranaike .
two vintage
frigates, two converted minesweepers, a seaward defense boat, a dozen
