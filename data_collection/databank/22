italy adjusting the apertura ever since premier amintore
fanfani teamed up with pietro nenni's socialists almost a year ago to
form italy's apertura a sinistra ( " opening to the left " ), the
uneasy alliance has been clouded by a single issue : nenni's demand
for the creation of 15 regional administrations that he figures will
boost his party's grass-roots support . fanfani agreed to pay nenni's
price because he needed the socialists' 88 votes in the chamber of
deputies in order to stay in power, but he stalled on enacting the
scheme just the same . fanfani feared that the socialists would sign
local electoral agreements with communists and thereby convert the new
regions into leftist strongholds . even after nenni pledged not to
cooperate with the reds, many of fanfani's christian democrats remained
skeptical of his promise . with nenni demanding quick action on the
regional plan, the looming alternative was compromise or collapse of
the coalition . last week fanfani acted . after nine hours of argument,
christian democrats and their two smaller coalition partners agreed to
introduce promptly two bills covering taxation and administration of
the regions ; they postponed legislation actually creating them until
a new parliament convenes after national elections in may . the
socialists grumbled bitterly, but nenni urged them to bide their time .
/ if there's going to be a government crisis, " he told a meeting of
his party's central committee, " it's not going to be caused by us . "
nenni has his eye on a cabinet post in a new government ; causing a
crisis at the moment would be irresponsible, for fanfani this week goes
off to visit john f . kennedy, and in a fortnight harold macmillan
arrives in rome . fellow travelers in the socialist high command were
willing, even anxious, to topple the government, but as the party
continued its talks at week's end, it appeared that nenni and the
coalition would squeak through .
