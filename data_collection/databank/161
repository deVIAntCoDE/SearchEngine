russia        the wolves like wolves in winter, the circle of communist
critics tightened around brash young poet evgeny evtushenko last week .
the kremlin announced a full meeting of the communist party central
committee next month to discuss " ideological " matters meaning the
crackdown on evtushenko and other maverick intellectuals . the official
organ of the moscow writers union, literaturnaya rossiya, backed a
reader's suggestion that evtushenko be thrown out of the union a move
that would reduce the high-living poet to poverty, since state
publishing houses would no longer accept his work . even cosmonaut yuri
gagarin joined the wolf pack snarling at evtushenko's heels . following
up earlier attacks on the poet for daring to evade soviet censorship by
publishing his autobiography in france, gagarin said the act
demonstrated " an unforgivable lack of responsibility . /
