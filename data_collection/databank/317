poland way of the cross at jasna gora monastery, the most sacred
shrine in poland, stefan cardinal wyszynski last week blasted growing
communist efforts to curtail church activities . speaking to groups of
the more than 100,000 pilgrims gathered to celebrate the feast of the
assumption, the cardinal cited a government ban on organized
pilgrimages and protested against roadblocks where some pilgrims had
been harassed during the trip to the shrine, enduring their own " way
of the cross . " ostensibly, the ban resulted from a smallpox outbreak
in the vicinity, but there was no interference with nonreligious
tourists . on another front, the reds refused to let children at
state-run summer camps attend mass . said wyszynski : " the state does
not have the right to prohibit everything . if a citizen does not
demand his rights, he is no longer a citizen . he becomes a slave . "
