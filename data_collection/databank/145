russia a fine italian hand the paucity of facts in moscow lends
a certain credibility to every rumor about the kremlin, especially when
it concerns the supposed ups and downs of nikita khrushchev. thus it
was last week that a whisper from moscow via rome became a blast of hot
air felt around the world . it all began with a moscow dispatch by
giuseppe boffa, correspondent for italy's communist newspaper l'unita,
which soberly described soviet troubles in domestic and foreign affairs
and at one point permitted itself the flat assertion that " moscow is
living through a delicate and interesting political moment . " rome's
volatile press erupted with screaming headlines predicting nikita's
imminent downfall . big papers in new york,london and paris gave way to
similar speculation . though khrushchev was surely under pressure, he
did not act like a fellow on the skids . he sent a note to his poison
pen pal mao tse-tung politely declining mao's invitation to talk over
the sino-soviet split in peking (time, march 22). instead he invited
mao or a group of colleagues to moscow . suggested time for the
confrontation of quarreling communists : in the spring or summer, "
which are good seasons of the year in our country . /
even the ups and downs of soviet space technology
were shrouded in uncertainty last week . moscow launched a fourth moon
probe, but with typical secrecy did not reveal its mission . the size
of lunik iv (1f tons) led some western scientists to believe it was
designed to carry out a soft landing on the moon . but after 3f days in
flight, lunik iv missed the moon by 5,281 miles . was lunik iv a flop
? tass reported only that experiments " had been carried out, " then
curtly added it would have nothing more to report about the flight .
