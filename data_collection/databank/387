japan vote of confidence for ikeda japan's new election
regulations severely limit campaign activities, but the country's
politicians are masters at circumventing the rules . faced with a
$7,000 limit on campaign expenditures, many a candidate in last week's
general elections simply followed an old practice of having
contributions funneled through " research institutes . " since
candidates were restricted to three posters each (v . the previous
limit of 12,000), many " accidentally " dropped cards, complete with
picture and slogan, in telephone booths, department stores, bars and
buses . on rainy days, one aspirant even had his campaign workers
approach commuters and hand out armloads of umbrellas ; when they were
opened, the candidate's name spread out in huge characters painted on
the umbrella surface . for all the uproar over procedures, the election
amounted to an important vote of confidence for pro-capitalist
pro-western premier hayato ikeda, 63 . the socialist opposition zeroed
in on the nagging inflation that has accompanied japan's phenomenal
economic boom . economist ikeda, whistle-stopping across the nation,
retorted that incomes have risen 52 per cent in the past three years,
while prices have risen only 14 per cent . at a kyoto rally, he asked
: " which do you think is better ? the socialists' advocacy of
dividing three eggs among four people ? or ikeda's policy of dividing
eight eggs among four people ? " on election day, amid the shriek of
sirens that reminded people to vote, ikeda's liberal-democratic party
won control of the 467-seat house of representatives for another four
years, although the government's 283-seat total fell three short of its
share in the old house . the socialists gained seven seats for a total
of 144 . the more moderate democratic socialists picked up nine
additional seats, for a total of 23 .
