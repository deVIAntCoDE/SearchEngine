the communists love the idea . they are saying reassuringly that they
would not make france pull out of the common market or nato as the
price of "workers' unity ." that is the same sweet line the
communists are taking in italy, where the reds's longtime allies,
the leftist nenni socialists, are on the verge of entering the
government . while french solialists are cozying up to moscow,
charles de gaulle is making sheep's eyes at peking as part of his
strategy of the higher politics . he would like to revive france's
dusty influence in asia . commenting on the coup in south viet nam,
information minister alain peyrefitte last week renewed de gaulle's
proposal, plainly designed to embarrass the u.s ., of a united and
neutral north and south viet nam "free of foreign influences ." a
national association of manufacturers, has just returned from
a month's trip to red china encouraged by the prospect of increasing
trade .  also bound for peking was ex-premier edgar faure, who has
long urged french diplomatic recognition of red china . though
traveling "unofficially," faure carried a message from de gaulle
to mao tse-tung that reportedly deplores communist china's isolation .
while ruling out formal recognition in the near future, premier georges
totter off viktor ivanovich and several others head for clinics while
the stewardesses inventory bed sheets . one passenger wrote the
minister of the river fleet : " everywhere we saw posters urging the
personnel to fight for better service for passengers . perhaps they'll
stop fighting and simply start behaving in an ordinary, human manner
toward us, giving us for our money (pardon this detail) what we are
legally entitled to ! " but as wise old viktor ivanovich says : "
alas, it's this way not only on boats . /
