israel the man without enemies to the ceremonial blare of a ram's
horn, israel's third president was sworn into office last week . he was
schneor zalman shazar, 73, a balding, bespectacled scholar of jewish
history . the country's first minister of education, he was elected by
the knesset to fill the vacancy caused by the death of izhak ben-zvi
last month . russian-born shazar emigrated to palestine via central
europe during the '20s, was hand-picked for the job by an old
political crony, premier david ben-gurion . shazar has another
important qualification . as ben-gurion puts it, he is " a man without
enemies . " normally soft-spoken, shazar is an impassioned, skillful
orator when he gets onto a speaker's platform . during last month's
commemoration of the warsaw ghetto uprising, shazar brought the
audience to tears simply by repeating the word " warsaw " in hushed
tones before beginning his address ; on another occasion he was so
carried away by his own oratory that he fell off the stage and had to
be taken to the hospital for a badly sprained leg . shazar is also
notoriously absent-minded . years ago in poland, the story goes, he
boarded a train only to find that he had lost his rail ticket . assured
by the conductor that he could buy another, shazar replied : " i know,
but if i don't find the ticket i won't know where i'm going . /
shazar's original surname was
rubashov, but like many veteran zionists, he hebraized his name . david
green became david ben-gurion ; isaac shimshelevitz became izhak
ben-zvi . schneor zalman rubashov became shazar by combining the
initials of his first, middle and last names . an exception to the
common practice : israel's first president, who remained chaim
weizmann .
