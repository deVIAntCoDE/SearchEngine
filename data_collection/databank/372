ghana  justice, black & white  no one more stridently denounces
south africa's violations of human rights than ghana's kwame nkrumah .
last week he dispatched a recorded diatribe to an anti-apartheid
rally in london, whose participants protested the law under which
south african citizens may be jailed for interminably repeated
90-day stretches . the very next day nkrumah armed himself with a
measure that makes the south african statute look pale by
comparison . since 1958 nkrumah has wielded a law allowing his
government to lock up any ghanaian without trial for five years, merely
by charging that the activities of the accused might prejudice
national defense, relations with other countries or security .
last week the accra parliament shouted through an amendment authorizing
the president to extend for an additional five years the detention
period of anyone held under the original act . the amendment
is believed aimed at 40-odd opposition leaders who have been in prison
since november 1958, accused (but never convicted) of conspiring to
assassinate government ministers and to poison the main accra water
reservoir .
