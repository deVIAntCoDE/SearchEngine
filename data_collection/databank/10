egypt up the rebels it was victory day in port said, six years
exactly since the last british soldier left suez . there to celebrate
the occasion was egypt's president gamal abdel nasser . as 20,000
egyptians cheered, nasser called the british from queen to commonor "
sons of bitches, " sneered at his critics, and ridiculed as a pair of "
nuts " jordan's king hussein and saudi arabia's king saud because they
oppose egypt's military venture in yemen, where nasser supports the
rebel abdullah sallal . " brothers ! " cried nasser . " this is not
the yemeni people's battle . it is our battle, because the more people
we can win over from imperialism and reaction, the more our power is
increased . revolution will soon triumph everywhere against reaction
! " nasser promised that israel's turn would come as soon as " we get
rid of saud and hussein, who conspire with zionism and imperialism to
preserve their own thrones and fortunes . nasser proudly watched a
parade of egyptian might 60 new soviet-built 5-54 tanks, antiaircraft
detachments, batteries of tactical rockets, and dismissed reports that
more than 10,000 egyptians had been lost in the yemen campaign,
insisted that the actual number of egyptian dead was only 136 .
washington was wrong if it thought that nasser would withdraw egyptian
forces and leave the area in peace in exchange for u.s . diplomatic
recognition of yemen's revolutionary regime . instead, nasser made it
clear at port said that he plans to stay in yemen, the better to export
revolution into the british-protected states ranging from kuwait in the
north of the arabian peninsula to aden in the south as well as to
syria, jordan and saudi arabia .
