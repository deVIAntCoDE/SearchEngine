red china fixing frontiers red china produced a second surprise
last week . at peking airport, premier chou en-lai welcomed outer
mongolia's premier yumzhagiin tsedenbal, 46, who is normally regarded
as a russian puppet . whisked off in a black, soviet-made limousine
among crowds dutifully waving chinese and mongolian flags, tsedenbal
was put through the usual routine of toasts, banquets and fulsome
speeches . then, on the same day that red china announced plans to
define its borders with pakistan, tsedenbal and chou en-lai signed a
treaty fixing the 2,500-mile frontier between their two countries . it
was another little lesson aimed at delhi . at the farewell banquet for
tsedenbal, premier chou en-lai smoothly noted that red china had now
solved its border problems on the basis of " peaceful coexistence "
with burma, nepal, pakistan and outer mongolia, making the point that
only two neighbors now remain with whom china has not made a border
adjustment : india and the soviet union .
