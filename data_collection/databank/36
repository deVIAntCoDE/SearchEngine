south arabia
and aden makes twelve with its stupefying temperatures and bleak
terrain, britain's aden colony on the southwestern fringe of the
arabian peninsula is one of the world's most unattractive pieces of
real estate . but it has its value nonetheless . between suez and
singapore, it is the only suitable fueling and victualing station for
the british navy, and 8,000 troops of her majesty's middle east command
are stationed on its 75 square miles of overheated rock . to strengthen
the precious little colony against the covetous desires of nearby
yemen, the british since 1959 have been linking neighboring sultanates
and emirates in a new federation of south arabia . aden was to join in
march, but an outburst of riots sparked by pro-yemen labor leaders and
the emergence of an egyptian backed nationalist regime in yemen itself
persuaded britain to speed things up . last week the british made aden
the twelfth member of the federation, retaining control but vaguely
promising eventual independence . arab nationalists were unhappy .
while the federation's black, yellow, green and blue flag went up over
government buildings in place of the union jack, anti-federation
residents raised mourning flags instead .
