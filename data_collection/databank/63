kashmir as prickly as cactus as the third round of the kashmir
talks began in karachi last week, a cactus plant was prominently placed
on the negotiating table in front of india's chief negotiator sardar
swaran singh an apt symbol of just how prickly the dispute between
india and pakistan still remains . yet by the end of the day, the first
faint glimmer of compromise was visible . in a sharp departure from its
previous inflexible stand, india indicated that it would be willing to
partition kashmir along a boundary other than the current u.n .
cease-fire line, which now gives india two-thirds of the province,
including all of the rich vale of kashmir . the new indian proposal
called for india to keep ladakh, part of which is currently occupied by
red china, most of the predominantly hindu area of jammu, and one-half
of the vale, including the province's capital of srinigar . pakistan
would get the rest of the province, plus rights of free access for all
its citizens to the indian parts of the province . though pakistan
still says it wants all of kashmir, it has sidetracked its demand for a
plebiscite over the whole area, which is 77 per cent moslem . the
prospect is for another round of negotiations in april this time in new
delhi .
