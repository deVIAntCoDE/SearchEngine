south viet nam the strain of constant combat after a week of
major battles, furious fighting and heavy casualties (time, jan . 11),
the war in south viet nam settled back last week into its normal
pattern of vicious, hide-and-seek, hit-and-run engagements . one band
of communist viet cong guerrillas beheaded a government provincial
district chief northwest of saigon, and another knocked over a
strategic hamlet in the northeast, capturing enough u.s . weapons to
equip an entire red company . with u.s . helicopter crews working
overtime, government troops killed and wounded 75 viet cong and
captured tons of supplies in a sweep through a redinfested area near
the cambodian border . but the strain of constant combat was beginning
to tell on the u.s . chopper pilots . heading back to base after 15
hours of continuous assaults against red positions one night last week,
a u.s . whirlybird suddenly toppled out of formation and, with its red
flying lights carving crazy patterns in the darkness over the mekong
river, spun into the ground . when rescue workers reached the copter's
twisted wreckage, they found the mangled bodies of seven u.s . crew
members . with ten americans already killed in 1963, one uiser remarked
bitterly : " it looks like this is going to be a hell of a year for us.
