communists getting together ? " despise the enemy
strategically, " wrote mao tse-tung in his handbook for
revolutionaries, " but take him seriously tactically . " last week,

the communist movement has reached a critical juncture . the time has
come when differences have to be settled, " declared the red chinese,
proposing that russia's premier stop off in peking on the way to
cambodia, where a state visit by khrushchev has been discussed for some

to moscow to discuss the squabble . but the haughty, patronizing tone
of the message, offering to meet the soviets only " on the basis of
full equality, " and repeating the old demands for a one-way
compromise, would make it tough for russia to accept . even in the
