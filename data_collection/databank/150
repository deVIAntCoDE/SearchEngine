west germany the price of silence until last week chancellor
konrad adenauer's christian democrats had won a majority among the
rural, conservative voters of rhineland-palatinate in every election
since the west german republic was founded in 1949 . but the latest
vote for the state legislature gave the c.d.u . only 46 of 100 seats,
and 44.4 per cent of the popular vote, a loss of 4 per cent since
the 1959 election . the socialists, by contrast, moved up from 37 seats
to 43 in the conservative stronghold, taking 40.7 per cent of the vote,
a gain of nearly 6 per cent . cried socialist spokesman fritz barsig :
/ the ice is finally broken . " the c.d.u . would continue to govern
rhineland-palatinate in coalition with the free democrats, but it was
clear that its loss there was the most damaging that the party had
suffered in five state elections in the past 16 months . taking stock,
c.d.u . officials were now certain that the fault lay with der alte's
obstinate fight to hang onto his post, blocking the succession of
economics minister ludwig erhard . despite adenauer's towering contempt
for him, " uncle ludwig " is by far the most popular politician in the
country ; a recent public-opinion poll showed that he is regarded by
25 per cent of the voters as the best man to succeed adenauer, whereas
socialist leader willy brandt is favored by only 12 per cent . but with
federal elections only two years away, 32 per cent of those polled now
look on the socialists as the " most sympathetic party, " while only 30
per cent so regard the c.d.u . a threeman c.d.u . committee chosen to
name the next chancellor appears convinced that only erhard can reverse
the tide . but adenauer holds out against a quick decision . for the
socialists, who hope to whittle c.d.u . margins even more dramatically
in four other state elections before mid-1964, der alte's continued
silence can be golden .
