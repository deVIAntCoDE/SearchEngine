communists nikita & the other cheek as peking's people's
congress met in secret to hear the latest word on the status of the
sino-soviet feud, among other topics, communist china cut loose with
one of its most scathing personal attacks to date on nikita khrushchev
. in simultaneous articles, red flag and people's daily accused him of
paralyzing the russian armed forces, of kowtowing to the capitalists
and of sounding too holy by far . " it is clear, " said the chinese,
that " in spite of khrushchev's bible-reading and psalmsinging, u.s .
imperialists have not become beautiful angels . they have not turned
into compassionate buddhas in spite of his prayers and incenseburning .
/ in short, said red china, khrushchev is " a laughing stock . " the
blast may well open a new rift between moscow and peking, even though
the kremlin has been relatively restrained in recent weeks . for as
khrushchev once asserted : " there is much in christ that is common
with us communists . but i cannot agree with him when he says that when
you are hit on the right cheek, turn the left cheek . if i am hit on
the left cheek, i hit back on the right cheek so hard that his head
might fall off . /
