diplomacy persona non grata insurance in his office in rural
maidenhead, insurance broker john dobbin opened his london times last
week, scanned the big story from moscow, and reached apprehensively for
a list of his clients . he breathed a sigh of relief . of the ten
british and u.s . diplomats who had been declared persona non grata by
the soviet government, none had insured his stay in moscow with j.n .
dobbin & co . since 1960, the firm has offered a unique policy to
protect western diplomatic and military officers against the prime
hazard of assignment to moscow : sudden expulsion, and the often
considerable personal loss that it involves, from the cost of russian
lessons to the tab for the farewell party . for a $210 annual premium,
a western foreign service officer can get the $5,000 persona non grata
coverage for two years, the average tour of duty . as the word of
dobbin's diplomatic coverage got around, personnel assigned to the
other iron curtain capitals have also sent to maidenhead for p.n.g .
policies . to date, dobbin and his clients have been lucky . of some 50
diplomats thus insured, only two have collected consolation money .
