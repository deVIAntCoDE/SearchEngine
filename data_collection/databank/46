india buying time after two days of bitter debate in new delhi's
lok sabha, the indian parliament last week approved prime minister
nehru's decision to accept a neutralist proposal for the settlement of
india's himalayan border dispute with red china provided that the
chinese also agree to the neutrals' plan in toto . under the
arrangement devised by the six nonaligned nations ghana, egypt,
indonesia, burma, cambodia and ceylon at the colombo conference last
december, the chinese will be forced to withdraw 12f miles from the
present cease-fire line in the northwestern himalayas . but the
resultant demilitarized zone will still recognize china's pre-invasion
claim to 14,000 sq . mi . of indian territory in ladakh . by his
willingness to negotiate on these terms, nehru hopes to stall the
chinese at the conference table until he can get more military aid from
the west . recently, nehru repeated his urgent request to president
kennedy that a joint western air mission " get here as soon as possible
/ to study plans for the air defense of india .
due in new delhi this week is a team of u.s ., british,
canadian and australian air force officers . foreseen is the
lengthening of indian runways and the establishment of a radar network
so that western interceptor squadrons, complete with pilots and ground
personnel, can move into india to provide a protective air umbrella
over its cities . the idea would not quite constitute a military
alliance, but it would surely be india's most decisive step away from
neutralism .
