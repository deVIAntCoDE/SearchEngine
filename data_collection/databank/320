algeria ben bellism algeria's premier ahmed ben bella is moving
ever closer to complete one-man rule . last week venerable, ailing
ex-premier ferhat abbas, 63, quit his post as speaker of the assembly
and handed out a 15-page critique of the government . he was chiefly
upset because ben bella keeps ignoring the assembly, even read the
country's new, strongly centralized constitution to a meeting of his
own followers at an algiers movie theater before submitting it to the
deputies . asked abbas : " why should we agree to a constitution that
has been prostituted in a cinema ? " abbas conceded that ben bella's
regime is not going communist but warned that " we do seem to be
heading toward a fascist dictatorship " . though ben bella remarks
acidly that " revolutions are not hade without prisons, " ben bellism
is not fascism . critic abbas was blasted as a " bourgeois spokesman
for privilege " by government-run newspapers and drummed out of the
national liberation front, which he once headed . but he was permitted
to retire quietly to his villa in kouba, outside algiers, thereby
joining the ranks of ben bella's other muffled but unharmed opponents,
such as mohammed boudiaf, who is under house arrest, and ex-premier
benyoussef benkhedda, who has quit politics to resume his career as a
druggist .
