italy off & running for italy's 243 elected senators and 596
deputies, all roads led out of rome last week . getting the jump on the
presidential decree formally dissolving parliament, the politicians
scurried home to start campaigning in the first general election in
five years . if the april 28-29 election were only a personal
popularity contest, short (5 ft . 1 in.), mustachioed premier amintore
fanfani, 55, might find himself out of a job . fanfani is shrewd, not
simpatico ,; behind his back, critics call him and his aides i
bassotti (the dachshunds) . more than fanfani's looks and cold
political style are against him . a 6 per cent jump in living costs
last year touched off a prolonged wave of strikes by industrial and
whitecollar workers ; fortnight ago, 5,000,000 workers quit their jobs
in a one-day general walkout . fanfani's year-old partnership with
pietro nenni's left-wing socialists, the apertura a sinistra (opening
to the left), has sharply divided the premier's own christian
democratic party ; the coalition's major legislative accomplishment
the needless and expensive nationalization of the electrical industry,
which was nenni's price for collaboration has turned many businessmen
against the government . still, fanfani figures to stay on top . of the
six nations in the common market, italy's estimated 6 per cent growth
rate this year is the highest ; at about 1,000,000, unemployment is
half the 1956 level . many italians fear that flirtation with that old
stalin prizewinner pietro nenni will eventually lead italy down the
path to neutralism . but so far, nenni has pulled to the right in
international affairs, away from his longtime communist allies . he has
even halfheartedly endorsed a nato nuclear force . nenni was probably
saved a little socialistic embarrassment when the u.s . recently agreed
to pull its jupiter missiles out of italy .
